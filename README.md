first project are scary , since you dont much about the enviroment your working with 

this project is showing the power and efficiency of django-forms and django admin interface .

There is a lot of changes that need to be made for this project to work quite well , but i put the source code here that you guys can download and use as your first project with a python based framework and a quite good template (CSS and HTML templates).
